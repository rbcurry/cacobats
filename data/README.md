Raw and transformed habitat data for modeling roost selection. Raw data originates from `roost.csv` and is separated into two species datasets, `epfu` and `myse`. Both of these get an incrementing identifier with each major operation, e.g., after plotting scale of effect and choosing a radius size for each of the landscape-scale variables, the dataset is saved as `epfu1` and is ready to move on to the next step.
