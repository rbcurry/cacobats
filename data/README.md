This folder contains raw and transformed roost selection data for use in modeling habitat selection by EPFU and MYSE at Cape Cod National Seashore. Roost locations were obtained via radio telemetry during summer 2015-2016, with local-scale habitat covariates collected on site and landscape-scale covariates derived subsequently from pre-existing datasets.
